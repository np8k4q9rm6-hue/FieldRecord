# FieldRecord – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 02/05/2026

CodePeregrine LLC ("we", "our") values your privacy. FieldRecord is designed to operate entirely on-device. We do not collect, store, or transmit your data to our servers. There are no analytics or cloud sync services involved.

## Introduction
This privacy policy explains how your data is handled when using FieldRecord. Our app operates fully on-device, ensuring your information stays private and under your control.

## Data We Do Not Collect
- No account creation
- No analytics or tracking
- No personal data collection
- No background data transmissions
- No third-party advertising SDKs

## Data Stored On Your Device
- item files you import or create (photos, videos, audio, documents, notes)
- Metadata you create (titles, notes, tags, case info)
- Device metadata saved into item (device model, OS version)
- Integrity hashes (SHA-256) and file sizes
- Optional GPS coordinates if you choose to include location

All data resides locally on your device unless you choose to export or share it. We do not have access to your data.

## Optional Data You Share
If you use the system share sheet, email, or other export features, your data may be shared according to the destination you choose. We do not receive or process this data.

## Third‑Party Services
The app uses Apple frameworks (e.g., SwiftUI, SwiftData, VisionKit, AVFoundation). We do not integrate third-party analytics or advertising.

## Security
- item files can be protected using iOS file protection (enabled by default) and are excluded from iCloud backups.
- You can enable biometric lock for app access (if supported by your device).
- Always follow your organization’s policies for handling sensitive data.

## Children’s Privacy
This app is intended for professional use. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
