# Privacy Policy for FieldRecord — Secure Field Notes

Last updated: 2026-02-05

FieldRecord is designed to help you capture, organize, and export field documentation. We respect your privacy and minimize data collection. This policy explains what data we handle and how.

## What We Collect
FieldRecord does not collect analytics or advertising data. All content you capture remains on your device unless you choose to export or share it.

The app may access:
- Photos, videos, audio, and documents you capture in the app
- Location data (only when you enable location for geotagging)
- Basic device info saved with items (e.g., device model, OS version) to provide context in reports

## How Your Data Is Used
- To create and manage your items (photos, videos, audio, documents)
- To geotag items (when enabled) with coordinates and accuracy
- To generate exports (PDF, CSV, ZIP) with metadata and integrity hashes
- To show your items on a map and in reports

We do not sell or share your data with third parties. Exports you create are under your control.

## Subscriptions and Purchases
Subscriptions are processed by Apple. We do not receive your payment information. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your App Store account settings.

## Data Storage and Security
- Your content is stored locally on your device unless you export or share it.
- File integrity hashes (e.g., SHA-256) may be included in reports to help verify authenticity.
- If you delete the app, locally stored data is removed unless backed up externally.

## Third-Party Services
FieldRecord uses Apple frameworks (e.g., StoreKit, MapKit, AVFoundation). These operate under Apple’s privacy policies.
